# Installing Pi-hole on Docker

Pi-hole is a network-wide ad blocker that can be installed on Docker. This guide provides the steps to install and set up Pi-hole on a Docker container.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Docker installed on your system. You can check this by running:

```bash
docker --version
```

If Docker is not installed, follow the instructions on the [official Docker installation page](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to install Docker.

## Step-by-Step Installation

### Step 1: Create Docker Compose File

Create a file named `docker-compose.yml` in your desired directory and paste the following configuration into the file:

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  pihole:
    container_name: pihole
    image: pihole/pihole:latest
    environment:
      TZ: 'America/New_York'
      WEBPASSWORD: 'yourpassword'  # Set your desired web interface password here
    volumes:
      - './pihole:/etc/pihole'
      - './dnsmasq.d:/etc/dnsmasq.d'
    ports:
      - "53:53/tcp"
      - "53:53/udp"
      - "8081:80/tcp"
    restart: unless-stopped
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN
```

### Step 2: Adjust Environment Variables

Ensure you adjust the environment variables (`TZ` and `WEBPASSWORD`) as per your requirements:

- **TZ**: Timezone (set to `America/New_York` for US Eastern Standard Time or your local timezone).
- **WEBPASSWORD**: Password for the Pi-hole web interface.

### Step 3: Create Necessary Directories

Create the directories for Pi-hole to store its configuration files:

```bash
mkdir -p pihole dnsmasq.d
```

### Step 4: Run Docker Compose

Navigate to the directory containing your `docker-compose.yml` file and run the following command to start the Pi-hole service:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This command will download the necessary Docker image and start the container.

### Step 5: Access Pi-hole Web Interface

Open your web browser and navigate to `http://<your-docker-host-ip>:8081`. You should see the Pi-hole web interface.

### Step 6: Configure Your Network

To use Pi-hole as your DNS server, you need to configure your router or individual devices to use the Docker host's IP address as the DNS server.

## Example Commands

Below are the commands provided in one block for easy copy-pasting:

```bash
# Create a Docker Compose file with the following content
cat <<EOF > docker-compose.yml
version: "3"
services:
  pihole:
    container_name: pihole
    image: pihole/pihole:latest
    environment:
      TZ: 'America/New_York'
      WEBPASSWORD: 'yourpassword'
    volumes:
      - './pihole:/etc/pihole'
      - './dnsmasq.d:/etc/dnsmasq.d'
    ports:
      - "53:53/tcp"
      - "53:53/udp"
      - "8081:80/tcp"
    restart: unless-stopped
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN
EOF

# Create necessary directories
mkdir -p pihole dnsmasq.d

# Start Pi-hole using Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d
```

## Additional Information

For more details and advanced configurations, refer to the official [Pi-hole Documentation](https://docs.pi-hole.net/).

By following these steps, you will have Pi-hole set up and running on Docker, allowing you to block ads across your entire network.
