# Installing Portainer on Docker

Portainer is a lightweight management UI which allows you to easily manage your Docker environments. This guide provides the steps to install and set up Portainer on Docker.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Docker installed on your system. You can check this by running:

```bash
docker --version
```

If Docker is not installed, follow the instructions on the [official Docker installation page](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to install Docker.

## Step-by-Step Installation

### Step 1: Create a Docker Volume for Portainer Data

Create a Docker volume to store Portainer's persistent data:

```bash
docker volume create portainer_data
```

### Step 2: Run Portainer

Run Portainer as a Docker container. This command will pull the latest Portainer image from Docker Hub and run it:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 -p 9443:9443 --name=portainer --restart=always -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v portainer_data:/data portainer/portainer-ce:latest
```

### Step 3: Access Portainer

Open your web browser and navigate to `https://localhost:9443`. You will be prompted to create an admin user and password.

### Step 4: Configure Portainer

After logging in, you can configure Portainer to manage your Docker environments.

### Example Commands

Below are the commands provided in one block for easy copy-pasting:

```bash
# Create a Docker volume for Portainer data
docker volume create portainer_data

# Run Portainer container
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 -p 9443:9443 --name=portainer --restart=always -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v portainer_data:/data portainer/portainer-ce:latest
```
