# Command Line Instructions

This section provides command line instructions for managing and interacting with your Docker containers.

## List Docker Containers

To list all running Docker containers, use the following command:

```bash
docker ps
```

## Start a Docker Container

To start a Docker container, use the following command, replacing `container_name` with the name or ID of your container:

```bash
docker start container_name
```

## Stop a Docker Container

To stop a Docker container, use the following command, replacing `container_name` with the name or ID of your container:

```bash
docker stop container_name
```

## Remove a Docker Container

To remove a Docker container, use the following command, replacing `container_name` with the name or ID of your container:

```bash
docker rm container_name
```

## View Container Logs

To view the logs of a Docker container, use the following command, replacing `container_name` with the name or ID of your container:

```bash
docker logs container_name
```

## Docker Network Information

To view information about Docker networks, use the following command:

```bash
docker network ls
```

## Connect a Container to a Network

To connect a Docker container to a network, use the following command, replacing `network_name` and `container_name` with the appropriate names:

```bash
docker network connect network_name container_name
```

## Disconnect a Container from a Network

To disconnect a Docker container from a network, use the following command, replacing `network_name` and `container_name` with the appropriate names:

```bash
docker network disconnect network_name container_name
```

## Example Network Configuration

Here is an example configuration of a Docker network with multiple containers:

- **Network Name**: `my_network`
- **Containers**:
  - `web_server` (HTTP port 80)
  - `database` (TCP port 3306)
  - `cache` (TCP port 6379)

### Commands to Set Up the Network

1. Create the network:

```bash
docker network create my_network
```

2. Run the containers and connect them to the network:

```bash
docker run -d --name web_server --network my_network nginx
docker run -d --name database --network my_network mysql
docker run -d --name cache --network my_network redis
```

3. Verify the network connections:

```bash
docker network inspect my_network
```

# Installing Portainer

Portainer is a lightweight management UI which allows you to easily manage your Docker environments. This section provides the steps to install and set up Portainer.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Docker installed on your system. You can check this by running:

```bash
docker --version
```

## Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Create a Docker Volume for Portainer Data**

Create a Docker volume to store Portainer's persistent data:

```bash
docker volume create portainer_data
```

2. **Run Portainer**

Run Portainer as a Docker container. This command will pull the latest Portainer image from Docker Hub and run it:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 -p 9443:9443 --name=portainer --restart=always -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v portainer_data:/data portainer/portainer-ce:latest
```

3. **Access Portainer**

Open your web browser and navigate to `https://localhost:9443`. You will be prompted to create an admin user and password.

4. **Configure Portainer**

After logging in, you can configure Portainer to manage your Docker environments.

### Example Commands

Below are the commands provided in one block for easy copy-pasting:

```bash
# Create a Docker volume for Portainer data
docker volume create portainer_data

# Run Portainer container
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 -p 9443:9443 --name=portainer --restart=always -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v portainer_data:/data portainer/portainer-ce:latest
```

## Additional Information

For more details and advanced configurations, refer to the official [Portainer Documentation](https://docs.portainer.io/v/ce-2.9/).

By following these steps, you will have Portainer installed and running, allowing you to manage your Docker environment through a web-based interface.
```

This combined section provides comprehensive command line instructions for Docker management and Portainer installation, ready to be copied and pasted into your README.md file.
