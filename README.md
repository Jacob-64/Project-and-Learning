    * <u/>**Project: Remove metadata from a file**</u>.
       * <ins>Reason:</ins> for operational reasons photos needed all metatdata whiped before file upload. This script allowed us to do that.
       * <ins>Thoughts:</ins> this was a fun simple project I used books I bought from Amazon and the internet to wirte this code. I am sure I could have found this already, but I wanted to write this myself.
   * <u/>**Project: Cipher Substitution with rotational shifts**</u>.
       * <ins>Reason:</ins>
The cipher implemented in your script is a substitution cipher with rotational shifts. Specifically, it resembles a Caesar cipher or ROT cipher, but with a twist:

Substitution Cipher: Each character in the outer key (the alphabet plus {}) is substituted with the corresponding character in the inner key.

Rotational Shift: The inner key (which is a deque) is rotated with each iteration, effectively trying different shifts to decode the message.
