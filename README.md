    * <u>**Project: Remove metadata from a file**</u>.
       * Reason: for operational reasons photos needed all metatdata whiped before file upload. This script allowed us to do that.
       * Thoughts: this was a fun simple project I used books I bought from Amazon and the internet to wirte this code. I am sure I could have found this already, but I wanted to write this myself.
