# Installing Heimdall on Docker

Heimdall is a way to organize all those links to your most used websites and web applications in a simple way. It is a homepage for your web applications.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Docker installed on your system. You can check this by running:

```bash
docker --version
```

If Docker is not installed, follow the instructions on the [official Docker installation page](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to install Docker.

## Step-by-Step Installation

### Step 1: Create Docker Compose File

Create a file named `docker-compose.yml` in your desired directory and paste the following configuration into the file:

```yaml
version: "2.1"
services:
  heimdall:
    image: lscr.io/linuxserver/heimdall:latest
    container_name: heimdall
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=America/New_York
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config
    ports:
      - 8080:80
      - 8443:443
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### Step 2: Adjust Environment Variables

Ensure you adjust the environment variables (`PUID`, `PGID`, and `TZ`) as per your requirements:

- **PUID**: User ID of the user running the container (you can find it by running `id -u` in your terminal).
- **PGID**: Group ID of the user running the container (you can find it by running `id -g` in your terminal).
- **TZ**: Timezone (set to `America/New_York` for US Eastern Standard Time).

### Step 3: Run Docker Compose

Navigate to the directory containing your `docker-compose.yml` file and run the following command to start the Heimdall service:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This command will download the necessary Docker image and start the container.

### Step 4: Access Heimdall

Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`. You should see the Heimdall homepage.

### Step 5: Persist Configuration

The configuration for Heimdall will be stored in the `./config` directory relative to where your `docker-compose.yml` file is located. Ensure this directory exists and has the correct permissions.

## Example Commands

Below are the commands provided in one block for easy copy-pasting:

```bash
# Create a Docker Compose file with the following content
cat <<EOF > docker-compose.yml
version: "2.1"
services:
  heimdall:
    image: lscr.io/linuxserver/heimdall:latest
    container_name: heimdall
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=America/New_York
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config
    ports:
      - 8080:80
      - 8443:443
    restart: unless-stopped
EOF

# Start Heimdall using Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d
```

## Additional Information

For more details and advanced configurations, refer to the official [Heimdall Documentation](https://heimdall.site/).

By following these steps, you will have Heimdall set up and running using Docker, allowing you to organize your web applications efficiently.
